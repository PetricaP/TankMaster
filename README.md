# Tank Master
This was a game I made as a project for my Object Oriented Design class.
* I used Java and Swing for implemnting it and even implemented a JSON serializer and a JSON parser to save my entities to be able to resume games after the game was closed (hopefully not crashed).
* I also used this JSON serializability of my game entities to design levels.
* The scores were saved to a SQLite database as it was required for us to use a DB, however I didn't have much knowledge about them at that point and stored the entities in my game on disk in JSON instead of using the DB.
